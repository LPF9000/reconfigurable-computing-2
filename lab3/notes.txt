timing analysis:
analyzing your module in isolation from any other design
do not want mapping to pins (use virtual pins)

maybe do on the reset also (can do in gui)

optimize based on the slowest model

setup summary slack, total negative slack

open timing analyzer

report setup summary
(right-click report timing on slack instead)

count bottleneck
(don't have to add every cycle) (multicycle path) (add setup and hold constraing and multicycle constraint) set to 2 multicycle path

count fifo bottleneck

pass pipeline to absortion fifo
-ready signal 
	-send almost full to input fifo to affect logic for readfifo
